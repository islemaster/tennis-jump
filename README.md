# Tennis Jump
A one-button game for two players. [Play now!](https://islemaster.github.io/tennis-jump)

Originally built as a demo game for Code.org's Game Lab sprite editor.  This version is updated to run on the brand-new [p5.play v3](https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play) library, outside of Game Lab.

Older versions:
  - v5: https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/XTiROHdHBhywT7P5D-Y-aA \
    Manually set frameRate to 60 (after default changed to 30)
  - v4: https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/cNPz3iv6WqsRIp1fJxpI5Q \
    Adjusted ball physics: Not 100% bounciness anymore, and can apply spin which has a subtle effect when bouncing on the ground.
  - v3: https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/sBcfnlCtW13IOUFSOGcfJg \
    Added game start/end states and in-game reset (TOURNAMENT MODE)
  - v2: https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/Q3-r_Yr4kz_-Fl_N4fejFA \
    Players have simple jump animations
